WebringÂ² is a little webring site that's linked to on a NFC ring. It advances to the next site in the list every time you scan it, by way of identifying you with your IP. The repo also contains some commented-out WebRTC calls that were intended to more specifically identify users from their self-reported local IP, but privacy measures usually block this nowadays.
